## Overview

This project showcases the application of design patterns in the context of a Japanese dessert shop. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage caf√© operations, such as product creation and order processing. The system is designed using various design patterns, including the Factory Method Pattern, Command Pattern, and Singleton Pattern, to ensure efficient and scalable operations.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add and manage Japanese desserts like mochi and dorayaki using the Factory Method Pattern.
- **Order Processing**: Handle customer orders efficiently with the Command Pattern.
- **System Architecture**: Organized structure with UML diagrams (class and sequence diagrams) to illustrate system interactions.
- **Scalable Design**: Utilizes design patterns to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## Installation

This project is written in Java using BlueJ, an educational IDE for Java development. Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NsamaX/Japanese-Dessert-Shop.git
   ```

2. **Install BlueJ**:  
   Download and install BlueJ from the official website: [https://www.bluej.org/](https://www.bluej.org/). BlueJ includes everything needed to compile and run Java code.

3. **Open the Project in BlueJ**:  
   - Launch BlueJ.  
   - Select "Open Project" from the menu and navigate to the cloned repository folder.  
   - BlueJ will load the project, showing the class diagram with classes like `Main`, `ProductFactory`, `OrderController`, etc.

4. **Compile and Run**:  
   - In BlueJ, right-click on the classes and select "Compile" to build the project.  
   - To run, right-click on the `Main` class (or the entry point class) and select "void main(String[] args)" to execute the program.  
   - The program runs in a console-like interface within BlueJ, allowing interactions like viewing menus, adding products, or processing orders.
